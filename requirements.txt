# Actual requirements
# =============================================================================
# - Include everything that is imported without "try / except ImportError"
#   handling.
# - Include as few version requirements as possible.
# - Keep it to pure-Python packages (for e.g. Windows installation with no 
#   compiler).

# The following are NOT HANDLED GRACEFULLY; their absence will cause a runtime
# ImportError, but we don't make them requirements as they need a compiler to
# install (and one might want to use the rest of the library without them).
