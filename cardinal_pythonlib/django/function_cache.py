    Takes a function and its args/kwargs, and produces a string description
    of the function call (the call signature) suitable for use as a cache key.
    The string is an MD5 hash of the JSON-encoded call signature.
    The logic behind these decisions is as follows:

    - We have a bunch of components of arbitrary type, and we need to get
      a unique string out.
    - We shouldn't use ``str()``, because that is often poorly specified; e.g.
      is ``'a.b.c'`` a ``TableId``, or is it a ``ColumnId`` with no ``'db'``
      field?
    - We could use ``repr()``: sometimes that gives us helpful things that
      could in principle be passed to ``eval()``, in which case ``repr()``
      would be fine, but sometimes it doesn't, and gives unhelpful things like
      ``'<__main__.Thing object at 0x7ff3093ebda0>'``.
    - However, if something encodes to JSON, that representation should
      be reversible and thus contain the right sort of information.
    - Note also that bound methods will come with a ``self`` argument, for
      which the address may be very relevant...
    - Let's go with ``repr()``. Users of the cache decorator should not pass
      objects whose ``repr()`` includes the memory address of the object unless
      they want those objects to be treated as distinct.
    - Ah, no. The cache itself will pickle and unpickle things, and this
      will change memory addresses of objects. So we can't store a reference
      to an object using ``repr()`` and using ``cache.add()``/``pickle()`` and
      hope they'll come out the same.
    - Use the JSON after all.
    - And do it in ``get_call_signature()``, not here.
    - That means that any class we wish to decorate WITHOUT specifying a
      cache key manually must support JSON.
