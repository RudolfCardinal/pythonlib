**Tool to recognize and rescue Microsoft Office OpenXML files, even if they
have garbage appended to them. See the command-line help for details.**

Version history:

- Written 28 Sep 2017.

Notes:

- use the ``vbindiff`` tool to show *how* two binary files differ.

Output from ``zip -FF bad.zip --out good.zip``

.. code-block:: none

    Fix archive (-FF) - salvage what can
        zip warning: Missing end (EOCDR) signature - either this archive
                         is not readable or the end is damaged
    Is this a single-disk archive?  (y/n):

... and note there are some tabs in that, too.

More ``zip -FF`` output:

.. code-block:: none

    Fix archive (-FF) - salvage what can
     Found end record (EOCDR) - says expect 50828 splits
      Found archive comment
    Scanning for entries...


    Could not find:
      /home/rudolf/tmp/ziptest/00008470.z01

    Hit c      (change path to where this split file is)
        s      (skip this split)
        q      (abort archive - quit)
        e      (end this archive - no more splits)
        z      (look for .zip split - the last split)
     or ENTER  (try reading this split again):


More ``zip -FF`` output:

.. code-block:: none

    zip: malloc.c:2394: sysmalloc: ...

... this heralds a crash in ``zip``. We need to kill it; otherwise it just sits
there doing nothing and not asking for any input. Presumably this means the
file is badly corrupted (or not a zip at all).

Tool to recognize and rescue Microsoft Office OpenXML files, even if they have
garbage appended to them.

- Rationale: when you have accidentally deleted files from an NTFS disk, and
  they really matter, you should (a) stop what you're doing; (b) clone the disk
  to an image file using "dd" under Linux; (c) perform all subsequent
  operations on the cloned image (in read-only mode). Those steps might
  include:
    - ntfsundelete, to find files that the filesystem is still aware of;
    - scalpel, to find files based on their contents.

- Scalpel is great at finding stuff efficiently, but it works best when files
  can be defined by both a start (header) signature and an end (footer)
  signature. However, the Microsoft Office OpenXML file format has a
  recognizable header, but no standard footer. In these circumstances, Scalpel
  reads up to a certain limit that you specify in its configuration file. (To
  retrieve large Powerpoint files, this limit needs to be substantial, e.g.
  50 Mb or more, depending on your ways of working with Powerpoint.)

- That means that files emerging from a Scalpel search for DOCX/PPTX/XLSX files
  may be
    - false positives, having nothing to do with Office;
    - clean Office files (the least likely category!);
    - Office files with garbage stuck on the end.

- The OpenXML file format is just a zip file. If you stick too much garbage on
  the end of a zip file, zip readers will see it as corrupt.

- THIS TOOL detects (and optionally moves) potentially corrupted zipfiles based
  on file contents, by unzipping the file and checking for "inner" files with
  names like:

        File type       Contents filename signature (regular expression)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        DOCX            {DOCX_CONTENTS_REGEX_STR}
        PPTX            {PPTX_CONTENTS_REGEX_STR}
        XLSX            {XLSX_CONTENTS_REGEX_STR}

- WARNING: it's possible for an OpenXML file to contain more than one of these.
  If so, they may be mis-classified.

- If a file is not immediately readable as a zip, it uses Linux's "zip -FF" to
  repair zip files with corrupted ends, and tries again.

- Having found valid-looking files, you can elect to move them elsewhere.

- As an additional and VERY DANGEROUS operation, you can elect to delete files
  that this tool doesn't recognize. (Why? Because a 450Gb disk might produce
  well in excess of 1.7Tb of candidate files; many will be false positives and
  even the true positives will all be expanded to your file size limit, e.g.
  50 Mb. You may have a problem with available disk space, so running this tool
  regularly allows you to clear up the junk. Use the --run_every option to help
  with this.)
