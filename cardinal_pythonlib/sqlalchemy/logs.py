**Functions to assist with SQLAlchemy logs.**

import logging


def pre_disable_sqlalchemy_extra_echo_log() -> None:
    """
    Adds a null handler to the log named ``sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine``,
    which prevents a duplicated log stream being created later.

    Why is this necessary?

    If you create an SQLAlchemy :class:`Engine` with ``echo=True``, it creates
    an additional log to ``stdout``, via

    .. code-block:: python

        sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine.__init__()
        sqlalchemy.log.instance_logger()
        sqlalchemy.log.InstanceLogger.__init__()
        # ... which checks that the logger has no handlers and if not calls:
        sqlalchemy.log._add_default_handler()
        # ... which adds a handler to sys.stdout
    """
    log = logging.getLogger("sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine")
    log.addHandler(logging.NullHandler())
