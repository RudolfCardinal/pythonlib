    Under Windows, the only options are:

      Signal      Meaning                 Comment
      =========== ======================= =====================================

    To ignore, can do:

    .. code-block:: python

      signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)  # SIG_IGN = "ignore me"

    or pass a specified handler, as in the code here.
