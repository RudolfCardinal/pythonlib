*RECENT VERSION HISTORY*

First started in 2009.

**0.2.7, 2017-04-28**

- Fixed bug in ``rnc_extract_text`` that was using ``get_file_contents()`` as a
  converter when it wasn't accepting generic ``**kwargs``; now it is.

**0.2.8, 2017-04-28**

- Fixed DOCX table processing bug, in ``docx_process_table()``.

**0.2.10, 2017-04-29**

- Text fetch (for converters) was returning bytes, not str; fixed.

**0.2.11, 2017-04-29**

- Encoding auto-detection for text extraction from files.

**0.2.12 to 0.2.13, 2017-05-02**

- More file types support for simple text extraction.
- Better encoding support.

**1.0.0, 2017-08-05**

- Consolidation of common functions from multiple projects to reduce code
  duplication. Some modules renamed.

**1.0.1, 2017-08-14**

- PyPI/``setup.py`` bugfix (not all subpackages were uploaded).

**1.0.2, 2017-08-20 onwards**

- Metaclass functions added.
- Extensions to SQLAlchemy utility functions.

**1.0.3, 2017-10-18**

- Several small changes for CamCOPS.

**... to 1.0.8, 2017-11-29**

**1.0.9 to 1.0.10, 2018-01-05 + 2018-02-19**

- Additions to ``datetimefunc.py`` and improvements to ``sqlalchemy/dump.py`` for
  CamCOPS. Addition of ``slurm.py``.

**1.0.11, 2018-02-23**

- Automatic JSON encoding of ``Pendulum`` objects; see serialize.py
- Some DSP code.

**1.0.12, 2018-03-08**

- Fixed ``coerce_to_datetime()`` so it coerces Pendulum to datetime too.

**1.0.13, 2018-03-08**

- ``argparse_func``: ``str2bool()``, ``percentage()``, ``positive_int()``

**1.0.14, 2018-05-01**

- ``**kwargs`` options to ``json_encode()``

**1.0.15, 2018-05-04**

- There was a bad character in a comment in ``winservice.py``; fixed.

**1.0.16, 2018-05-22**

- New file ``sqlalchemy/engine_func.py``
- JSON serialization of ``pendulum.Date``
- ``@register_enum_for_json``

**1.0.17, 2018-05-27**

- lazy dictionaries

**1.0.18, 2018-06-29**

- update for Django 2.0+
- update for Pendulum 2.0+

**1.0.19 to 1.0.21, 2018-07-01 to 2018-07-02**

- ``psychiatry/drugs.py``
- version assertion commands (for R access via reticulate)

**1.0.22, 2018-07-07**

- ``as_sql`` (etc.) options to ``alembic_func.upgrade_database``

**1.0.23, 2018-07-23**

- separation of version string for ``setup.py``

**1.0.24, 2018-09-11 to 2018-09-14**

- extra debug option (``debug_wkhtmltopdf_args``) for ``get_pdf_from_html``
- Sphinx autodocumentation.
- ``create_base64encoded_randomness()`` removed from ``crypto.py`` as was
  duplicated in ``randomness.py``.
- removed all requirements (temporarily? permanently?) as we were having
  problems installing on machines with wrong compiler versions or absent
  compilers, but didn't need those specific sub-dependencies; so consequence is
  that packages that use this software need to add additional requirements.

**1.0.25, 2018-09-16**

- Dependencies put back, except dependency on ``regex`` removed.
- Further documentation.
- Duplicate hash-related functions removed from ``crypto.py``; better versions
  were in ``hash.py``.
- Bugfix to :func:`cardinal_pythonlib.sqlalchemy.schema.is_sqlatype_date` for
  more recent versions of SQLAlchemy (e.g. 1.2.11). Error was:
  ``AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes' has no attribute
  '_DateAffinity'``.

**1.0.26, 2018-09-21**

- Bugfix to
  :func:`cardinal_pythonlib.sqlalchemy.orm_inspect.deepcopy_sqla_object`;
  crash if ``objmap`` was ``None``.

**1.0.26, 2018-09-22**

- Make everything except pure-Python dependencies optional.
- Work out what those are with
  :func:`cardinal_pythonlib.modules.is_c_extension`.
- public docs at https://cardinalpythonlib.readthedocs.io/

**1.0.27 to 1.0.29, 2018-09-23 to 2018-09-28**

- ``sphinxtools.py`` to help with building documentation
- added ``pygments`` dependency

**1.0.30, 2018-10-10**

- ``email/mailboxpurge.py``
- ``emailfunc.py`` renamed to - ``email/sendmail.py``

**1.0.32, 2018-10-16**

- ``typing_helpers.py``

- updated
  :class:`cardinal_pythonlib.django.fields.restrictedcontentfile.ContentTypeRestrictedFileField`
  to cope with Django 2.1.

- improvements to :class`cardinal_pythonlib.sphinxtools.AutodocIndex` in
  relation to filename glob processing for ``skip_globs``

**1.0.33, 2018-11-02**

- bugfix to
  :func:`cardinal_pythonlib.sqlalchemy.schema.convert_sqla_type_for_dialect`;
  this is meant to autoconvert ``TIMESTAMP`` fields in SQL Server, but it was
  checking against :class:`sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes.TIMESTAMP` and should have
  been checking against :class:`sqlalchemy.dialects.mssql.base.TIMESTAMP`.
