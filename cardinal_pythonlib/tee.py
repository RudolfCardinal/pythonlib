**Support functions for "tee" functionality.**

DEVELOPMENT NOTES

Initial failure:

- We can copy the Python logging output to a file; that's part of the
  standard logging facility.
- We can also redirect our own stdout/stderr to a file and/or print a copy;
  that's pretty easy to.
- We can manually capture subprocess stdout/stderr.
- We can redirect our own and subprocess stdout/stderr to a genuine file by
  duplicating the file descriptor(s):
  https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/redirecting-all-kinds-of-stdout-in-python/
- However, that file descriptor duplication method needs our file-like object
  to behave properly like a C-level file. That precludes the simpler kinds of
  "tee" behaviour in which a Python class pretends to be a file by
  implementing write(), close(), flush() methods.

So:

- redirect plain Python stderr/stdout
- handle subprocess stuff

    A note on text versus binary IO:

    TEXT files include:

    - files opened in text mode (``"r"``, ``"rt"``, ``"w"``, ``"wt"``)
    - ``sys.stdin``, ``sys.stdout``
    - ``io.StringIO()``; see
      https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file

    BINARY files include:

    - files opened in binary mode (``"rb"``, ``"wb"``, ``"rb+"``...)
    - ``sys.stdin.buffer``, ``sys.stdout.buffer``
    - ``io.BytesIO()``
    - ``gzip.GzipFile()``; see
      https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-binary-file
